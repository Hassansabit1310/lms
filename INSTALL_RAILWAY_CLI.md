```

## For Linux:

curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
```

## Login and Usage:

railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run commands
railway run php artisan admin:fix-access your-email@domain.com

# View logs
railway logs

```

## Alternative: Use Railway Dashboard

If CLI installation fails, use the Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to railway.app â†’ Your Project
2. Click "Deployments" â†’ Latest deployment
3. Look for build logs to see if admin fix ran automatically
4. Use the debug route: `/debug/admin-access`
